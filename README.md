# react-router
# Lab 39
## Goal
Create a application in react that can run load an 'API' and allow the user to add items, edit the contained data and delete points from the list.
## Architecture
All of the components used are factored out into their own files. The 3 main components are the list display, edit display and the Add. The list is used on the home page to show all stored values. The add obviously adds another value to the model. And the detail allows you to edit the information in the list.
## Getting Started
To run this application on your computer there are 2 commands you need to run. This will only work if you have `npm` installed.<br>
First: `npm i`<br>
Second: `npm start`
